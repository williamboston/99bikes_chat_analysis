# 99bikes_chat_analysis

A CSV reader for Chat analysis at work - takes an exported CSV from Zendesk with chat data and exports a new CSV detailling each chat topic with a corresponding fequency count.

Output CSV remains static so can be added to over time, keeping track of all previous data.

Currently just runs from Terminal, taking "java Chat_Analysis {zendesk_csv_name}" as args.
